### Overview
Choose `SocialMediaApp`. This homework focuses on implementing recycler view to the application. You may use View-Based UI or Jetpack Compose to complete this task.

_! If you want, you can apply this application to both. However, it will be sufficient to choose and apply one of them during the evaluation phase._

### Requirements
1. **Post Feed with Multiple View Types**: Add a `RecyclerView` with multiple view types to display different post formats (e.g., text-only, image posts, polls).
2. **Creating a Comments Section**: In each post, allow users to click on a "comment" button to open a collapsible or expandable comment section.
3. **Infinite Scrolling**: Implement infinite scrolling to load more posts when the user reaches the bottom of the list.
4. **Swipe-to-Delete and Drag-and-Drop**: Allow users to delete or reorder posts using gestures.
5. **Nested RecyclerViews**: Add a `RecyclerView` inside another `RecyclerView` to simulate features like stories or horizontal scrolling of media within a post.
6. **Liked Posts and Animations**: Add "like" functionality to posts with animations.
7. **Adding New Posts**: Allow users to create new posts and display them at the top of the feed.
8. **Shimmer Effect for Loading**: Add delay to the post and display a shimmer effect while loading posts.
9. **Real-Time Updates**: Simulate real-time updates to the post feed, such as adding a new post every few seconds.

### Learning Goals:
- Practice implementing and managing `RecyclerView` adapters and `ViewHolder`s.
- Practice using LayoutManagers (e.g., LinearLayoutManager, GridLayoutManager).
- Practice handling user interactions, animations, and updates efficiently.
