Create a program where the computer generates a random 4-digit number with no repeating digits. The user must guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback in the form of:

- `+` for each digit that is correct and in the correct position.
- `-` for each digit that is correct but in the wrong position.
  
The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number or runs out of attempts.

### Function Description
Implement the function `guessTheNumber() -> String`.

- No parameters are required for the function as it handles interaction with the user directly.

The function should return:

- A string containing the feedback for the guess, formatted as `+ - -` (or other combinations of `+` and `-`).
- If the guess is invalid (e.g., not 4 digits or contains repeating digits), return `Invalid input. Please enter a ${NUM_DIGITS}-digit number.`.
- After the game ends (either by correctly guessing the number or running out of attempts), the function prints a message and ends the game.

### Game Logic

1.**Generating the Secret Number**:

The secret number is a random 4-digit number, with no repeating digits. This is generated by shuffling the digits from `0-9` and taking the first 4 digits.

2.**User Input**:
The user is prompted to enter a 4-digit guess. If the guess is invalid (e.g., contains repeated digits or is not a 4-digit number), the program will ask the user to enter a valid guess.

3.**Feedback**:
After each guess, the program compares the guess to the secret number and provides feedback:

- `+` is added for each digit that is correct and in the right position.
- `-` is added for each digit that is correct but in the wrong position.

The feedback is provided as a string, sorted alphabetically (e.g., `++-` instead of `+-+`).

4.**Game End Condition**:

The game ends either when the user guesses the number correctly (i.e., gets four `+` symbols) or when they run out of guesses (the maximum number of guesses is reached).

**Sample Input 1**
```
secret = 2345  
guess = 2134
```
**Sample Output 1**
```
+ - -
```

**Explanation**
In Sample Input 1, `2` is in the correct position, and `3` and `4` are correct digits but in the wrong positions. This results in `+ - -`.

**Sample Input 2**
```
secret = 5678 
guess = 1234
```
**Sample Output 2**
```

```

**Explanation**
In Sample Input 2, none of the guessed digits match the secret number, so no feedback is provided.

**Sample Input 3**
```
secret = 1234 
guess = 1243
```
**Sample Output 3**
```
+ + - -
```

**Explanation**
In Sample Input 3, `1` and `2` are in the correct positions, `3` and `4` is a correct digit but in the wrong position. This results in `+ + - -`.
