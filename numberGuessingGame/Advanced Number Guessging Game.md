Create a program where the computer generates a random 4-digit number with no repeating digits. The user must guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback in the form of:

- `+` for each digit that is correct and in the correct position.
- `-` for each digit that is correct but in the wrong position.
  
The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number or runs out of attempts.

### Function Description
Implement the function `guessFeedback(secret: String, guess: String) -> String`.

- `secret` (string): The 4-digit random number generated by the computer (no repeated digits).
- `guess` (string): The 4-digit number guessed by the user.
  
The function should return:

- A string containing the feedback for the guess, formatted as `+ - -` (or other combinations of `+` and `-`).
- If the guess is invalid (e.g., not 4 digits or contains repeating digits), return "Error: Invalid guess".
  
### Input Format
You do not need to handle input/output directly. Your function will be tested with the following inputs:

- A string `secret` representing the 4-digit number generated by the computer.
- A string `guess` representing the userâ€™s guess.
  
### Constraints
- `secret` is a 4-digit string containing unique digits (`0-9`).
- `guess` is a 4-digit string containing unique digits (`0-9`).

**Game Logic**

The feedback helps the user refine their guesses:

- A `+` indicates a digit is correct and in the correct position.
- A `-` indicates a digit is correct but in the wrong position.
The game ends when the user correctly guesses the secret number (four `+` symbols) or runs out of attempts.

**Sample Input 1**
```
secret = 2345  
guess = 2134
```
**Sample Output 1**
```
+ - -
```

**Explanation**
In Sample Input 1, `2` is in the correct position, and `3` and `4` are correct digits but in the wrong positions. This results in `+ - -`.

**Sample Input 2**
```
secret = 5678 
guess = 1234
```
**Sample Output 2**
```

```

**Explanation**
In Sample Input 2, none of the guessed digits match the secret number, so no feedback is provided.

**Sample Input 3**
```
secret = 1234 
guess = 1243
```
**Sample Output 3**
```
+ + -
```

**Explanation**
In Sample Input 3, `1` and `2` are in the correct positions, and `4` is a correct digit but in the wrong position. This results in `+ + -`.
