### Overview:
Create a simple app with support for splitting bills among multiple people after tip added. This homework focuses on building a basic UI and handling user interactions. Either View-Based UI or Jetpack Compose can be used.

### Requirements:
1. Create a UI with the following components:
- An `EditText` for the user to enter the bill amount.
- Multiple `Button`s for selecting a tip percentage (e.g., 10%, 15%, 20%).
- An `EditText` for specifying the number of people splitting the bill.
- `TextView` elements to display:
    - Total tip amount.
    - Total bill amount.
    - Per-person amount.
2. Calculate and display updated values as the user inputs data.
3. Add validation to ensure inputs are valid (e.g., positive numbers).

### Learning Goals:
- Learn to combine multiple input methods (`EditText`, `Button`, etc.) in a single UI.
- Practice mathematical calculations in the app.
- Understand input validation and error handling.
- Understand updateing the ui programmatically.
