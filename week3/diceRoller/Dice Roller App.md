### Overview:
Create a simple app where users can roll a dice and see the result. This homework focuses on building a basic UI and handling user interactions. View-Based UI or Jetpack Compose can be used.

### Requirements:
1. Create a UI with the following components:
  - A `Button` labeled "Roll Dice."
  - A `TextView` to display the rolled number (1-6).
  - An `ImageView` to display the dice face corresponding to the rolled number.
2. When the user taps the button:
  - Generate a random number between 1 and 6.
  - Update the `TextView` with the number and the `ImageView` with the corresponding dice face image.
3. Include at least 6 dice face images in your `drawable` folder for numbers 1 to 6.

### Learning Goals:
- Understand how to create a basic app layout using `Button`, `TextView,` and `ImageView`.
- Learn to handle button click events using `onClickListener` or `onClick`.
- Practice generating random numbers in Kotlin.
- Understand resource management by using `drawable` assets for images.
