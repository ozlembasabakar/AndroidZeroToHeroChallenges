Write a program to simulate a number guessing game. The program generates a random integer between `1` and `100`. The user has 5 attempts to guess the number. After each incorrect guess, the program should indicate whether the guess is too high or too low.

### Function Description
Implement the function `guessNumber(guess: Int, randomNumber: Int, attempts: Int) -> String`.

- `guess` (int): The user's current guess.
- `randomNumber` (int): The correct number randomly generated by the system.
- `attempts` (int): The remaining number of attempts.

The function should return:

- If the guess is correct: `You win! The number was {randomNumber}`.
- If the guess is too high: `Too high!`.
- If the guess is too low: `Too low!`.
- If all attempts are used and the user has not guessed correctly: `You lose! The number was {randomNumber}`.
  
### Input Format
The function will be tested with the following inputs:

- An integer `guess` (user's guess).
- An integer `randomNumber` (the number to guess).
- An integer `attempts` (remaining attempts).
  
### Constraints
- `randomNumber` is an integer in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `guess` is an integer in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `attempts` is an integer in the range `[1, 5]`.
  
**Sample Input 1**
```
guess = 50  
randomNumber = 30  
attempts = 4
```
**Sample Output 1**
```
Too high!
```
**Sample Input 2**
```
guess = 30  
randomNumber = 30  
attempts = 3
```
**Sample Output 2**
```
You win! The number was 30
```
